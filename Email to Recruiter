Hi [Recruiter’s Name],

Thank you for selecting me for this incredible opportunity and for designing such an intriguing application process. I found the case study unique and was excited about the chance to explore the AI tools and ideas I had in mind.

Unfortunately, due to some personal family matters this week, I was unable to dedicate the time I had planned. I did submit a brief demo, but I was unable to fully expand on the ideas and tools I wanted to implement. 

This was an incredible opportunity, and I’d be grateful if I could be considered again for future opportunities. While I couldn’t give it my full attention this time, I appreciate the effort you put into the process. I would love to stay in touch in the future. 

Best,
Jashan
