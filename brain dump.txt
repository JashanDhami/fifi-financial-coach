little help from parent who never grasped these concepts forces younger generation to remain left behind or start research 

main source of information:

- google 
- TIKOK/IG Reels

people are trusting their social media for finanical advice: 
"A 2023 Ipsos survey showed that 50% of people globally trust news from social media, which is lower than trust in TV, radio, or print media"


app built around teaching anyone who is willing to learn 

features:
- follow their favorite content creator's financal plan, credit card recomendations

    - can had that AI tutor FIFI shift their recomdations based on the personal goals and content creator they trust 
- page will act as advice center for their finances

    - the app notices that user spends money on friday, depending on settings, user can have notifactions set up that it notifies the user "is that uber eats really worth it right now" 
    - lets work towards levels of goals, 
    - each time user builds towards goal FIFI also gets a small skin or clothing or accessory
        - recently saw hank green's app for mindfulness that has its bean character knit hats for itself, but cries when using the phone
